## üöÄ Technology Stack

### Frontend
* **React:** A declarative and component-based UI library.
* **Vite:** A fast and modern build tool for a great developer experience.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
* **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.

### Backend
* **Node.js & Express:** A powerful and flexible backend runtime and framework.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
* **JWT:** Secure, token-based authentication.
* **Streaming API:** A custom implementation for handling real-time data flow.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

This project is structured as a **monorepo**, containing both the frontend and backend services within a single repository. This approach simplifies development and dependency management while maintaining a clear separation of concerns. The frontend communicates with the backend via a **RESTful API** for authentication and data management, and a dedicated **streaming API** handles all real-time communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (>= 16.x)
* npm or yarn
* MongoDB Atlas or a local instance

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ConnectUs.git](https://github.com/your-username/ConnectUs.git)
    cd ConnectUs
    ```

2.  Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=<Your-MongoDB-Connection-String>
    JWT_SECRET=<A-Strong-Secret-Key>
    PORT=5000
    ```

### Running the Project

1.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    npm run dev:backend
    ```

2.  Start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    # In a new terminal, from the root directory
    npm run dev:frontend
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
